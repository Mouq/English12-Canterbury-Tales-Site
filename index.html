            Dear Reader,
<p>
Misogyny is a prominent issue in <a href='misogyny-now.html'>the modern world</a>. It is widely considered, though, that this was a much worse problem in <a href='misogyny-then.html'>the Medieval period</a>. The issue comes up in readings of Chaucer's <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>, and in particular as it is presented from different points of view in the <a href='clerks-tale.html'>tale of the Clerk</a> and the <a href='wifes-tale.html'>tale of the Wife of Bath</a>.
</p><p>
In the Clerk's tale, the view is presented that gives a portrait of what an <a href='idealwoman.html'>ideal woman</a> of the time acted like, and the abuses of her husband which were considered acceptable: in short, a tale illustrating how deeply ingrained and of-the-norm misogyny was at the time. The Wife's tale shows a little more complexity however: while a <a href='fairytale.html'>fairytale</a> at heart that still relies on misogynistic assumptions about society, it puts to question whether those cultural principles are correct.
