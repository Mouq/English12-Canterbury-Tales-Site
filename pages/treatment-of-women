<div class='title'>Treatment of Women<div class'subtitle'>Then and Now</div></div>
Medieval women were:
    <ul>
    <li>Treated as "less-than men"</li>
    <li>Perceived as their husband's property</li>
    <li>Subject to become her son's “property” if her father died</li>
    </ul>
In addition, peasant women did have jobs, but they weren’t important or glamorous. Women who didn’t follow the rules were beaten into submission

Today, the treatment of women has gotten better, and there's more equality between men and women, though statistics say that the way women are treated today can still be worked on, as described in <a href='http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/aug/16/poll-shows-mixed-feelings-about-feminism/'>The Washington Times</a>.
