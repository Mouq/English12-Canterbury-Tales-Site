Similar to <a href='clerks-tale.html'>the Clerk's tale</a>, the Wife's tale speaks of a patriarchial society, but one in which a woman's chief desire is for her own soveriegnty, as is specifically said in <a href='http://english.fsu.edu/canterbury/wife.html'>lines 1038-9</a>.

The Wife's tale tries to establish that a <i>completely</i> male-dominated society is not neccessarily for the best. While there are many elements of misogyny that are still acceptable in the story, such as the queen letting the knight get away with rape, or some of the self-demeaning assertions the hag puts forth in her argument (such as that women can't keep secrets, or that having a pretty woman is a trade-off with having a faithful woman), there is still an important strain of independence and power for woman that runs through the entire tale, be it from the queen decided the knight's fate, to the knight yeilding to his wife in the end, leading to the happy <a href='fairytale.html'>fairytale</a> ending.
